Roe solver for Euler equations

as far as self-gravitation goes ...
to incorporate this with gr, fluid would need to be pulled along geodesics, not just along the gradient of the potential ...
... and geodesics would be computed by the adm metric ...
... would a potential buffer exist?  no ...

also, don't forget, SelfGravitationBehavoir comes with solidBuffer ... TODO get rid of this
